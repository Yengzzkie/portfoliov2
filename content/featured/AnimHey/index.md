This application is a platform for streaming anime content, built with ReactJS. Key functionalities include browsing a wide range of anime titles and watching episodes. This project served as a practical exercise in my attempt to learn TailwindCSS. I am currently working on adding a backend for login and authentication so users can create their own personal watch list.
